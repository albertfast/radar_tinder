Location data may be collected to enable navigation, radar alerts, map-based features, or other location-aware functionality. Location access is used only when required by app features and permissions granted by the user.

Camera access may be used for optional features such as visual scanning, image capture, or content creation. Camera data is processed locally unless explicitly stated and is not stored or shared without user consent.

Microphone access may be used for features such as voice input or audio-based functionality. Audio data is not recorded or transmitted without explicit user action.

### d. Photos and Media
Access to photos or media files may be required for user-initiated uploads, editing, or content creation. Only files explicitly selected by the user are accessed.

### e. Bluetooth
Bluetooth access may be used to connect with nearby devices or sensors relevant to application functionality. No personal data is collected through Bluetooth scanning.

### f. Account Information
If an account is created, we may collect basic information such as email address for authentication and account management.

### g. Usage and Diagnostics Data
Anonymous usage data and diagnostics may be collected to improve performance, stability, and user experience.
